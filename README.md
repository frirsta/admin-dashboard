1.3 use case diagram

Below, I have used a use case diagram to illustrate the interactions between users and our system, showcasing the functionalities it can perform. From this diagram, you can see that the system has three users, and each user has different permissions. The company's operational team can create and delete users, while clients and testers can log in, modify their profiles, and perform logouts after receiving assigned accounts. Additionally, clients can create test orders within the system, which the company reviews and assigns to suitable testers. Once testers complete the testing and upload the reports, they are reviewed by the company's operational staff. If the review is successful, the customer is notified that they can download the results.
